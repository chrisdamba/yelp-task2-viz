    <p class="interaction">
      This implementation of a sunburst was based upon Sequences Sunburst by Kerry Rodden and Zoomable Sunburst by Mike Bostock. By exploring the visualization, it's possible to infer the different topics from the Yelp reviews data set.</p>
    <p class="interaction">Each SLICE in the large sunburst represents a topic. When you mouse over or click on a slice, the words composing the TOPIC are displayed in the center of the sunburst.</p>
    <p class="interaction">
      The BREADCRUMB helps orient you as you navigate the sunburst. It shows the most common word in each topic leading to the one you're currently exploring. If you click to zoom in on a topic, the ANCHOR offers more context by highlighting which portion of the full topic structure is currently displayed in the large sunburst.
